"""
few_shot_retriever.py

Loads the few-shot example bank from few_shot_examples.json and retrieves
the top-k most relevant examples for a given instruction.

Two responsibilities:
  1. Loading: reads few_shot_examples.json and returns a clean list of
     example dicts.
  2. Retrieval: scores all examples against the query instruction using a
     cross-encoder at startup, then returns the top-k most relevant ones.

On top of pure top-k ranking, retrieve() applies two coverage guarantees:
  1. At least one REJECTION example (status != "ok") is always present in
     the retrieved set, so the LLM always sees how to handle instructions
     it should be refusing.
  2. At least one OK example (status == "ok") is always present in the
     retrieved set, so the LLM always sees what a valid plan looks like.

Retrieval method:
  A cross-encoder scores every (query, example) pair jointly rather than
  independently, catching semantic matches that keyword overlap would miss.
