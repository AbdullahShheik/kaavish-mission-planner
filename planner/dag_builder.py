"""
dag_builder.py

Builds a NetworkX DAG from a validated plan and runs validation checks
on the plan structure.

Two responsibilities:
  1. build_dag(): converts a plan's subtask dependency lists into a
     NetworkX DiGraph where nodes are subtask ids and edges represent
     execution ordering constraints.
  2. validate_plan(): runs four checks on the plan and DAG to catch
     errors before the plan is dispatched to the solver.

Validation checks:
  1. No cycles in the DAG.
  2. No dangling dependency references.
  3. All required_skills exist in the retrieved skill bank.
  4. Args keys match the skill's inputs exactly.
